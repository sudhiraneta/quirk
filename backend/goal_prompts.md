# Goal-Based Questions for Users

Based on browsing patterns, ask users to define goals and evaluate alignment:

## LinkedIn (>30min/day)
**Question:** "You spent {time} on LinkedIn this week. What's your goal?"
**Options:**
- Looking for a new job
- Building professional network
- Learning from industry content
- Just browsing (no specific goal)

**Roast if misaligned:**
- ">2h LinkedIn scrolling - either commit to job search or admit you're procrastinating"

## ChatGPT/AI Tools (>2h/day)
**Question:** "Heavy ChatGPT usage detected ({time}). Learning or depending?"
**Roast:** "AI can't think for you - 5h on ChatGPT means you're outsourcing your brain"

## YouTube (>3h/day)
**Question:** "YouTube binge mode activated ({time}). Educational or entertainment?"
**Roast:** "6h YouTube daily - at least admit you're not 'researching'"

## Gmail (>1h/day)
**Question:** "Inbox time: {time}. Writing important emails or anxiety checking?"
**Roast:** "Email every 10min - inbox zero won't solve your problems"

## Time Limits (Non-Productive Activities)
- LinkedIn browsing: 30min/day max
- Social media: 1h/day max
- Video streaming: 3h/day max
- Email checking: 1h/day max
- AI chat: 2h/day max (unless coding)

## Goal Alignment Check
For each flagged activity, ask:
1. What's your goal with this platform?
2. Is your time usage helping you reach that goal?
3. If not, what needs to change?
